// This file is a template for embedding product-specific data. Doing
// that creates a derived work covered by the GPL. But you may prefer
// not to publish your data, for instance because it is proprietary.
// In that case, the GPL does not permit you to distribute the derived
// work at all. But read the second paragraph of section 0 of the GPL
// carefully: it permits you to run your modified version of the
// program--and to distribute its output, which is not a derived work
// because it's merely your data, trivially cast in a format suitable
// for use with lmi. You can therefore distribute the files created by
// your modified version of this program, but not that program itself.
// Those files are all you need: distributing the program itself isn't
// necessary anyway.
